        We are starting a new Haskell-focused podcast where we interview guests from the Haskell community. The hosts are Niki Vazou, Joachim Breitner, Andres LÃ¶h, Alejandro Serrano and Wouter Swierstra. In this teaser episode, we introduce ourselves. The first regular episode will appear very soon.
